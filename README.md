 # Time Progress Bar
 A progress bar plasmoid for your [KDE Plasma desktop](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) (only Plasma 6) showing the progress of time.

 Inspired by the year progress bar, it can show the progress of the year, month, week, day or an interval between two custom date-times.

 ## TODO
- make an icon
- proper UI to set custom start and end date
    - currently, you have to enter the date string in a text field.
    - it looks like neither Qt Quick nor Kirigami currently has a date picker.
